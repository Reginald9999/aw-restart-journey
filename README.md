ðŸ”¹ Personal Bio â€“ Polelo Ramokhele

What Have I Done? What Are My Interests in Tech?
My journey in tech began at Rosebank College, where I completed a Higher Certificate in IT Support Systems along with a CompTIA A+ certification. I gained foundational experience in network configuration, website design, virtual machine hosting, and IT support operations, which helped me build a strong technical base. I then progressed to a three-year Software Development qualification, where I engaged in hands-on learning with tools like Oracle SQL, C#, CSS, Java, and development environments such as NetBeans IDE and Visual Studio. I contributed to real-world projects, including:

â€¢	Designing a tracking system and database for a logistics company

â€¢	Developing a cloud-hosted website on Azure to support children with autism

This blend of development, cloud, and database work allowed me to discover what I truly enjoy in techâ€”working with data, solving problems, and building systems that have a positive impact.

What Are Your Career Goals or Aspirations?
My ideal career path lies in the data and security space. I aspire to become a:
Data Analyst or Data Scientist â€“ where I can uncover insights and support decision-making through data visualization and interpretation
Database Administrator â€“ managing, securing, and optimizing databases to ensure the integrity and accessibility of information
Information Security Analyst â€“ protecting systems and sensitive data from threats
Software Developer â€“ building scalable, functional applications that rely on clean data and secure infrastructure
I am fascinated by how data can drive innovation, and how it intersects with technologies like AI, cybersecurity, facial recognition, neural interfaces, and smart devices. Whether it's through analytics or development, I want to be part of shaping the future of technology in ethical, meaningful ways.
Even outside the cloud domain, I see immense value in the skills Iâ€™ve learnedâ€”especially in areas like data handling, encryption, and application developmentâ€”as foundational to my broader goals. My vision is to work in environments that use data to make a difference in industries such as healthcare, education, transport, or even tech-for-good start-ups.
